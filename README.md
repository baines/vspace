Overview

Vector space is a game I created for a week-long [Warwick Game Design](http://www.warwickgamedesign.co.uk/)
competition in 2010 with the theme "Dimension". With annoying music by myself!

      A catastrophic incident at SomeRandomCompany Inc. has
opened rifts into four convieniently different coloured dimensions
  and littered each of them with several asteroids which all look 
                        awfully similar.

Equipped with the See-Several-Dimensions-Simultaneously(tm) radar,
 it is down to you to traverse through the rifts and blow up all
       the asteroids thereby saving the galaxy somehow!
